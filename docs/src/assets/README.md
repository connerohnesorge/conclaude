## Mascot Image

The `mascot.svg` file is currently a placeholder. Please replace it with the actual mascot image:

**Source:** https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1cc33a-5e49-4e1c-b575-f6ab5e16374f

To download and replace:
```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1cc33a-5e49-4e1c-b575-f6ab5e16374f" -o mascot.png
```

The mascot is an orange/coral colored cartoon crab character that represents the conclaude project.

Once downloaded, you can either:
1. Keep it as `mascot.png` and update references in the code
2. Convert it to SVG if needed for better scalability
3. Keep both formats for different use cases
